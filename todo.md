## Review

### Summary of Changes

This session focused on improving the Contact form styling and fixing several visual and navigation issues across the portfolio.

### Contact Form Improvements

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/Contact/Contact.tsx`
- `src/index.css`

**Changes Made:**
1. **Removed CSS Conflicts**: Deleted global `.contact-container` styles from `src/index.css` (lines 132-162) that were forcing all inputs to 100% width and overriding Tailwind classes.

2. **Added Framer Motion Animations**: Integrated entrance animations matching the About and Projects sections:
   - 3D slide-in with 90-degree rotation
   - Staggered timing for header and form card
   - Fade-in animation for success message

3. **Form Layout Updates**:
   - Wrapped form in a styled card container (`bg-gray-700 p-8 rounded-xl shadow-lg`)
   - Widened name/email inputs from `max-w-xs` (320px) to `max-w-md` (448px)
   - Message textarea remains full width within the card
   - Adjusted spacing from `gap-5` to `gap-6`

4. **Enhanced Input Styling**:
   - Changed background from `bg-gray-700` to `bg-gray-600` for better contrast
   - Added subtle border (`border border-gray-500`)
   - Added smooth transitions (`transition-all duration-200`)

5. **Button Redesign**:
   - Changed from blue (`bg-blue-500`) to white (`bg-white`) with black text
   - Updated to rounded-full style matching Hero buttons
   - Added scale animations on hover and tap

6. **Added Section ID**: Added `id="contact"` for smooth scrolling from Hero section

### Hero Button Fixes

**File Modified:**
- `src/components/Hero/Hero.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Updated "Get in Touch" button from transparent border style to white background with black text
- Both Hero buttons now have consistent styling: `bg-white text-black rounded-full hover:bg-gray-200`

### Navigation Fix

**File Modified:**
- `src/components/Projects/Projects.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Added `id="projects"` to Projects section to enable "View Projects" link navigation from Hero

### Hero Image Background Effect

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/About/About.tsx`
- `src/components/Projects/Projects.tsx`
- `src/components/Contact/Contact.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Removed all section background colors:
  - About: Removed `bg-gradient-to-b from-gray-900 via-gray-800 to-gray-900`
  - Projects: Removed `bg-gray-800`
  - Contact: Removed `bg-gray-900`
- Hero image now visible behind all sections with scroll-based opacity overlay intact

### Tailwind v4 Configuration Fix

**Files Modified:**
- `src/index.css`
- `postcss.config.js`
- `package.json`

**Changes Made:**
1. Updated `src/index.css` from old Tailwind directives to v4 syntax:
   - Changed from `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`
   - To `@import "tailwindcss";`

2. Installed `@tailwindcss/postcss` package (v4 requirement)

3. Updated `postcss.config.js` to use `@tailwindcss/postcss` instead of `tailwindcss`

### Technical Notes

- **Tailwind v4 Breaking Changes**: The project uses Tailwind CSS v4.1.13, which has a completely different configuration system than v3. The PostCSS plugin is now in a separate package (`@tailwindcss/postcss`).

- **Animation Consistency**: Contact form now matches the animation style of About and Projects sections (90° rotation, 1.8s duration, custom easing curve).

- **Form Width Constraints**: The max-w-md class on name/email inputs was being overridden by global CSS. Removing the global styles fixed the issue.

### Visual Result

- Contact form now has professional card-style presentation matching the portfolio aesthetic
- All sections show the Hero image background with increasing opacity overlay as user scrolls
- Consistent white button styling across Hero and Contact sections
- Smooth animations and transitions throughout
- All navigation links working correctly
